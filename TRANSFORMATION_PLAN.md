### 2. NEW SECTION: What Are MCP Servers?

**Purpose:** Explain your technical advantage in business terms

**Content:**
```
## Why MCP Servers Matter for Your Business

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are the missing link between
AI and your business systems. Here's why that matters:

### The Old Way (What Everyone Else Does)
❌ Generic AI chatbots that can't access your data
❌ Manual copy-pasting between tools
❌ Security risks with API integrations
❌ One-off solutions that break when you scale

### The MCP Way (What We Do)
✅ AI directly connected to YOUR systems
✅ Real-time access to your databases, CRM, tools
✅ Enterprise-grade security by design
✅ Scalable architecture that grows with you

### What This Means for Your Business

**For Operations:** Your AI sees what your team sees—customer
data, inventory, invoices, metrics—and acts on it instantly.

**For Security:** Each MCP server is a secure bridge. No data
leaves your control. Access is logged, monitored, and can be
revoked instantly.

**For Performance:** No manual work. AI processes data where
it lives and returns results in milliseconds, not hours.

### Real Example: A Manufacturing Client

**Before:** Sales team manually checked inventory, emailed
production, waited 2-3 days for quotes.

**After (with MCP):** AI checks real-time inventory, schedules
production, generates quotes—in 30 seconds.

**Result:** 40% faster quote turnaround, 20% more sales.
```

servers act as secure bridges with full audit trails.
