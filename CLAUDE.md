## Reference Pattern Learning Rule

When implementing backend logic or complex components, you may consult the maryse-demo.atlas-ai.au codebase as a reference implementation to infer proven patterns, data flows, and architectural decisions.

Do NOT copy code verbatim.
Extract principles, flows, and constraints only.
Adapt all implementations to the current Atlas AI backend, stack, and conventions.
Document which pattern was learned and why it applies.
